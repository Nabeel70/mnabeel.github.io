Developed an end-to-end medical image segmentation system powered by TensorFlow U-Net, bolstered with mathematical optimization to refine boundary detection on noisy MRI data.

- Increased segmentation accuracy to 88-92% across heterogeneous datasets by tuning loss functions and post-processing heuristics.
- Containerized the workflow for reproducible experimentation and streamlined deployment to clinical research environments.
- Built evaluation dashboards to compare DICE, IOU, and Hausdorff metrics, accelerating medical stakeholder feedback cycles.
