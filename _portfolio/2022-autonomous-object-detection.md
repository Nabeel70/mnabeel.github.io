Engineered an end-to-end perception pipeline that fuses YOLOv3/v5 detectors with custom post-processing to keep autonomous vehicles situationally aware in rain, fog, and low-light conditions.

- Designed data augmentation routines targeting low-visibility edge cases to lift precision and recall by 14%.
- Implemented non-maximum suppression tuning and multi-scale inference for stable detections at highway speeds.
- Delivered deployment-ready Docker images with monitoring hooks for integration into real-time telemetry systems.
