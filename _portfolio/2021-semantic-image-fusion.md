Delivered a semantic-aware image fusion framework that integrates multispectral data to strengthen object detection in degraded visual environments.

- Combined MFNet backbones with attention-based fusion to preserve structural detail while suppressing noise.
- Automated hyperparameter sweeps that improved fusion accuracy to 95% and boosted downstream detection rates.
- Packaged evaluation scripts so research partners could benchmark new datasets with minimal onboarding friction.
