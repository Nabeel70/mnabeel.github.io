<p>Built a real-time driver drowsiness detection pipeline combining OpenCV for video capture, Dlib facial landmark analysis, and scikit-learn classifiers.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Captured micro-expressions and eye-aspect ratios at the edge to trigger fatigue warnings with sub-second latency.</li>
	<li>Used modular inference blocks so the system runs on embedded NVIDIA Jetson hardware as well as cloud GPUs.</li>
	<li>Delivered a monitoring dashboard for fleet supervisors with alert histories, timeline annotations, and exportable analytics.</li>
</ul>
